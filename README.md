# Starman

## Unity based project for our friend up in space

#### Class Requirement:

	Create an environment in Unity with some procedural aspect and some static aspect.

	For the static aspect, use at least one material and one audio clip.
	Come up with a coherent set of interactions that (they act on the same object, same effect on multiple objects, narrative progression, etc.).
	Implement one interaction based on Raycasting, one interaction based on button input, and one interaction based on motion (movement of controllers or headset).
	Implement a UI system that informs the audience about the state of the world.

#### General Ideas

we enjoy the last 5 mins of life, however we can. 
Which song do you pick?
